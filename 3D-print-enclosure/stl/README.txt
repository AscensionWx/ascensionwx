To produce a full sensor enclosure, the one needs to print multiples of some pieces. If your printer has two nozzles and a large enough print bed, you could try printing two of the items together to save time.

Here is the full list:

4x Single Enclosure Plate  ---> can print in "mirror" mode or "duplicate"
1x Single Enclosure Plate with hole
2x Single Enclosure Plate Top-Bottom  ---> can print in "mirror" mode or "duplicate"
1x Enclosure stand
