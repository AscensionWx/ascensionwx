Changes in this version:

GPS turns on at 3.8
overcharge turns false at 3.75
Low voltage threshold (less than 3.4)
Add send_status() message before Arduino loop in case lmic sent netwk packet at startup
Set SF10 at startup in lorawan.ino for 868mhz
Remove hard-code of center frequencies for 868mhz
If web app input fields are blank, don't store keys or restart
Physical damage check on bme280 (flag 128 if one or more weather values are unphysical)

Need test:
Find dead TTN 868mhz device on console
Plug in 868mhz gateway
Load 868mhz ascensionwx device with the keys
Try "poor" page loading and refreshes to test that keys are not overwritten
Make sure SF10 is seen in Helium console
