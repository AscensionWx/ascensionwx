Changes in this version:

GPS turns on at 3.9
overcharge turns false at 3.8
Remove low-power mode (was causing wrong rewards)
Increase GPS message cycle to 20 hours instead of 3
... naturally, means GPS turns on 3am for 5 mins once very 6 days
Add extra GPS message at the end of Arduino setup function
Reduce lmic wait window for RX1 and RX2 downlinks to 3 seconds instead of 5
Reduce std_dev threshold for indoor sensor to 1.4 instead of 1.5
Add temperature check of between 66 and 78 Farenheight for indoor sensor flag
Removed credentials.h file
Remove binary_upload, credentials, hardware_configs, img folders


Todo:


Test:
Compare it with other non-solar charging sensor
Watch 2 weeks to see how battery improves
Also watch GPS messages on new 0.4.3 firmware sensor 
   ...to make sure GPS messages are still very quickly after obs message
   ...and not needing the full 30 second window (can drain battery quickly)
Also watch GPS age to make sure it's never more than a week
